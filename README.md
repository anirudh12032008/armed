# Pixel ARM Assembly
This is my first ARM assembly program, it has currently 4 awesome pixel arts. It has 2 screen, the buffer screen and the pixel screen. the buffer screen is cleared and updated with each art and the pixel screen is used to visualize the art

I even added few delays with the help of a cool hack of using computations to create a delay.

It was really fun and pain to work with ARM assembly especially the pixel display part!!
